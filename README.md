# generative-logIA
AI framework project for automate the execute of AI generative open models workflows, such as LLM models, Stable Difusion, Warp Fusion, and many more in different computation frameworks (Kaggle, Google Colab).

# Concept
The main idea is to execute your generative project, and then connect to the computation APIs to orchestrate the notebooks or scripts on those platforms.
